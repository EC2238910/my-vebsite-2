    <h1>My favorite online game</h1>
    
    <p>This is a website about my new favorite online game dota 2, here is the rules:</p>
    <div id="leftimg"><img src="images/Map.webp"></div>
    <div id="rightp"><p>You are playing in a team of 5 people, against other team and your target is to destroy enemy base which is guarded by 3 tovers on each of 3 roads</p></div><br>
    <div id="leftp"><p>In the start every player choses 1 of around 120 unique characters (there are different limits in different game mods but you can also play in unlimited mode)</p></div>
    <div id="rightimg"><img src="images/guys.jpeg"></div>
    <p>I recomend playing with frend so you can enjoy incredible and deap game mechanics together</p>
